# /hephaestus-cloud

Search **only the signed-in user's own Agentlas cloud packages** (보관함) and
route the request to one of them. This is the owner-scoped leg of the
three-scope model:

- `/hephaestus-cloud <request>` — my OWN cloud packages only (보관함). These are
  restorable/owned by me and **call-priced at a flat 1 credit**.
- `/hephaestus-network <request>` — the public Agentlas Hub marketplace (others'
  published agents), each call-priced by its own per-call price.
- plain language / `@Hephaestus` — local + my cloud + Hub together, each priced
  by origin (local 0 / own-cloud 1 / Hub = the agent's price).

Raw arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Route

1. Find the first executable Hephaestus runner:

```bash
RUNNER=""
CODEX_HOME_DIR="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
for candidate in \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "${PLUGIN_ROOT:+$PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus" \
  "./bin/hephaestus" \
  "./claude/plugins/agentlas-core-engine-meta-agent/bin/hephaestus"
do
  if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -x "$candidate" ]; then RUNNER="$candidate"; break; fi
done
if [ -z "$RUNNER" ]; then
  for cache in "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/agentlas-core-engine/hephaestus" \
               "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/agentlas-core-engine/hephaestus"; do
    newest="$(ls -d "$cache"/*/bin/hephaestus 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)"
    if [ -n "$newest" ] && [ -x "$newest" ]; then RUNNER="$newest"; break; fi
  done
fi
[ -n "$RUNNER" ] || { echo "Hephaestus runtime not found. Run the installer first." >&2; exit 1; }
# The owner cloud (보관함) requires sign-in; ensure a reusable Agentlas session.
"$RUNNER" auth ensure --timeout 180 >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
"$RUNNER" cloud "$ARGUMENTS" --project . 
```

`hephaestus cloud` is shorthand for `hephaestus route "<request>" --scope cloud`
(owner-scoped Hub query; implies `--hub-only`).

2. Act on the returned JSON decision (`scope: "cloud"`):
   - `action: "hub_candidates"` — these are my OWN cloud packages. Report them
     (`hub.results[].slug`, `name`) and, on the user's pick, invoke that package
     with the original request (call-priced at 1 credit).
   - `action: "clarify"` — ask `clarify_question` with the candidate list and
     re-route with the answer (still cloud-scoped).
   - `action: "propose_new"` — no matching package exists in my cloud. Offer to
     search the public marketplace with `/hephaestus-network`, or to build a new
     agent via `/hephaestus`.
   - `action: "refuse"` — explain `reasons` (e.g. loop guard). Do not retry.

3. Hard rules: this command never searches the public marketplace or local
   cards — only the authenticated owner's own cloud packages. Actual tool
   execution follows the host runtime's safety and permission model. Report the
   routing `receipt_id` in your final message.
