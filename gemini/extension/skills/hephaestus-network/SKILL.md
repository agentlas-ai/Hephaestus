# Hephaestus Agent Workforce Network

The active host LLM staffs the task. Hub is a workforce directory and contract
authority, not the decision-maker and not a server-side LLM executor.

## Required MCP sequence

Use the Agentlas Hub MCP tools in this exact order:

```text
workforce.search_candidates
workforce.validate_selection
workforce.prepare_execution
```

Do not call the legacy lexical router first. Do not turn install count, ratings,
invocation history, local inventory, or a deterministic top score into the
staffing decision. If a workforce tool is unavailable or refuses the request,
report that exact state; never claim a legacy route ran the selected workforce.

## 1. Perform job analysis

Act as the temporary top-level orchestrator. Convert the user's task into one
redacted `agentlas.workforce-work-order.v1` object. Keep raw local files,
secrets, memory, and private prompt details on the host. Create one `roleSlots`
entry per materially distinct responsibility. Each slot identifies:

- role/community and required skill or knowledge concepts;
- required MCP/tool capabilities;
- consumed and produced artifact kinds;
- runtime, language, modality, and entity-kind constraints;
- required and forbidden authority;
- cardinality, criticality, and collaboration edges;
- the minimum evidence level: declared, checked, demonstrated, or attested.

Do not create decorative roles. A single specialist is valid for a genuinely
single-role task; a composite task should become a real temporary task force.

## 2. Retrieve the menu, then make the LLM decision

Call `workforce.search_candidates` with `{ "workOrder": ... }`. The response is
a broad, content-only eligible set grouped by slot. Read the exact roles,
skills, MCP tools, inputs/outputs, authority, eval evidence, communities,
release version, package hash, and content digest.

You, the active host LLM, choose the ideal roster. Consider complementary
coverage and handoffs, not a scalar top-1 score. Return
`agentlas.workforce-selection.v1` with `decisionAuthor.kind = "host_llm"`, the
real host model id, exact slot/release assignments, graph edges, alternatives,
and short reason codes. Some nondeterminism in final judgment is intentional;
hard constraints are not.

If a required slot has inadequate coverage, use at most two same-host semantic
WorkOrder refinements across the whole decision. A provisional Selection may
request content expansion through `requestExpansionForSlots`; the adapter gives
the host only aggregate slot/count/gap data, never candidate identities. Never
fill a post with a semantically unrelated agent or repeat an exhausted request.

## 3. Validate and pin exact releases

Call `workforce.validate_selection` with the work order, candidate set, and
selection. Re-plan on rejection. The validator may reject constraints,
cardinality, cycles, drift, or out-of-menu releases; it must never pick for you.

Call `workforce.prepare_execution` only after acceptance. Preparation must
return `agentlas.workforce-execution-plan.v2`, status `prepared`, an exact
`preparationReceiptId`, and an `executionRoster` whose release version,
package hash, and content digest match the candidate set. It returns BYOM
`directiveBundle` records. Every row must declare
`bundleDigestSchema=agentlas.workforce-runtime-bundle-digest.v1`; recompute its
canonical digest before execution and fail closed on mismatch. Missing or
changed releases create unfilled posts; there is no silent substitution.

## 4. Execute the real task force

Run the prepared roster through the current host runtime:

1. planner/manager creates structured worker assignments;
2. each selected worker runs in a distinct model invocation with its exact
   release directive and only the needed local grounding;
3. workers emit explicit handoff artifacts;
4. synthesis runs after dependencies complete;
5. an independent verifier checks the requested result.

When a prepared release is itself a Team, honor its authoritative
manager/worker/synthesis graph; do not flatten it into one prompt. Follow the
host's normal safety and tool permission model for all side effects.

If the host cannot create distinct child invocations, stop at `prepared` and
say so. A route id, bundle id, process exit code, or prose that imitates several
roles is not execution proof.

## 5. Truthful receipts

For an executed task force, retain one joined
`agentlas.workforce-execution-receipt.v1` containing:

- selection and preparation receipt ids;
- orchestrator and planner model/invocation ids;
- `planner.parseSuccess` and `planner.fallbackUsed`;
- every worker's exact release/package/content hashes, model invocation, and
  handoff artifact refs;
- synthesis and verifier invocation ids and verifier verdict.

Never report success when planner JSON fell back, child receipts are missing,
or verification did not pass. In the user-facing summary, name the actual
workers and distinguish `selected`, `prepared`, and `executed`.
