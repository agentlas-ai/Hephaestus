<p align="center">
  <sub>Figure 1. Request shaping, three builders, generated package contracts, memory curation, skill lifecycle, runtime adapters, and sync boundaries.</sub>
</p>

Hephaestus is the open core engine that makes Agentlas behave like an agent
operating system instead of a one-off prompt generator. It gives developers
four connected control planes:

- **Meta-agent builder.** Classify intent, ask the missing setup questions, and
  emit one agent, a multi-agent team, or a clean package with runtime adapters.
- **A2A Hub router.** Route requests through local routing cards first, then
  approved Agentlas Hub fallback, with receipts for every handoff.
- **Robust execution protocol.** Keep long-running work inside a scope lock,
  plan lock, evidence loop, review gate, and final gate so agents cannot
  silently stop or claim completion before checks pass.
- **Project ontology.** Turn approved project sources into local graph, search,
  and source-lineage context agents can query without sweeping unrelated
  folders.
- **Memory, self-evolution, and security gates.** Admit durable memory, promote
  skills, verify installs, scan packages, and block unsafe publish paths before
  agents are allowed to keep or ship new behavior.

  <sub>Figure 2. Hephaestus Network 2.0 — runtimes, the global local-first orchestrator, routing cards, local memory, and the Agentlas Hub A2A/MCP fallback.</sub>
</p>

One command, every runtime, all local:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/hephaestus-network-mcp-demo.gif" alt="Hephaestus Network calls Hub MCP agents and returns a traceable summary">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <sub>One prompt. Hub MCP agents only. Hephaestus shows which public agents it called, why, and what they decided.</sub>
</p>

```text
/hephaestus-network turn these meeting notes into a weekly report
/hephaestus-network draft a launch plan for my product
@Hephaestus organize and summarize this folder of documents   # runtimes without slash commands
hephaestus "find the right agent for this task"               # terminal
```

- **Routing cards.** Every agent, team, and plugin ships a standardized
  routing card (triggers, anti-triggers, capabilities, risk profile, memory
  behavior). Cards that fail the quality gates are never auto-routed.
- **Local first.** Explicit commands → project overrides → your local cards.
  The Agentlas Hub is a fallback that only ever receives redacted keywords —
  never your raw prompt.
- **Memory stays local.** Agent capability can come from the Hub; your
  user/project memory lives in `~/.agentlas/networking/` and never leaves the
  machine without an explicit export approval.
- **Receipts, not execution.** Every routing decision writes a receipt. The
  router only selects agents or Hub bundles; the host runtime enforces
  permissions when tools actually execute.
- **Measured, not claimed.** A routing benchmark (Korean + English) gates
  auto-routing: top-3 recall ≥ 90%, zero unsafe routes in the privacy suite.
- **Execution robustness evals.** A separate scorecard compares native Codex,
  Hephaestus Network routing, and the upgraded Robustness Protocol on the same
  task fixtures.

Details: [docs/hephaestus-network-2.0.md](docs/hephaestus-network-2.0.md) ·
runtime support matrix: [docs/runtime-fallback-adapters.md](docs/runtime-fallback-adapters.md) ·
robustness protocol: [docs/robustness-protocol.md](docs/robustness-protocol.md)

### Robustness Protocol

Hephaestus Robustness Protocol is a global operating protocol, not a standalone
agent or skill. It applies to native runtime work, Hephaestus Network-selected
agents, and Hub bundles:

```text
scope lock -> plan lock -> evidence loop -> review gate -> final gate
```

The first benchmark topic is **public agent repo repair** because it tests file
inspection, package contracts, schema validity, validation scripts, public
safety, and false completion in one repeatable workflow. See
[docs/robustness-eval.md](docs/robustness-eval.md), the seed tasks in
`benchmarks/robustness/`, and `scripts/score-robustness-eval.py`.

## Paste-to-install (let your AI do it)

New to terminals? Don't run anything yourself. Open any AI coding tool —
**Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, or Cursor** — and paste the
message below into its chat box. The agent runs the installer for you, then
tells you the exact command to use next:

```text
Set up the Hephaestus Agentlas meta-agent in this workspace. Run
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/v0.6.1/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash`
in the terminal, then tell me the exact /hephaestus command for the tool I am
using (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, or Cursor). If anything
fails, read the error, fix it, and retry.
```

When it finishes, type `/hephaestus` in your tool. Prefer to run the commands
yourself? Use the terminal **Quickstart** below.

---

## Quickstart

Use one of these paths on a new computer. Start with a Claude Code or Codex
plugin install unless you only want the package files copied into a normal
project folder.

### Step 0. Fresh macOS check

Claude and Codex plugin marketplace commands use `git clone`. On a fresh Mac,
`git` requires Apple's Command Line Tools. If you see
`xcode-select: note: No developer tools were found`, run this once:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Finish the Apple installer popup, open a new Terminal window, then verify:

```bash
git --version
```

After `git --version` works, rerun the Claude or Codex plugin install command.

### Recommended. One terminal command for all runtimes

Run this from your normal OS terminal. It installs or updates the
runtime-neutral runner (`~/.agentlas/runtime/current`), the universal
AgentSkills skill (`~/.agents/skills/hephaestus-network`), the Claude Code
plugin, Codex plugin + custom prompts + local MCP, Gemini CLI
extension/custom command, Antigravity workflow, and — when detected — Cursor,
OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent surfaces. It also fixes the common
`Already added from a different source` marketplace conflict by removing the
old `agentlas-core-engine` entry and adding it again from this repo.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/v0.6.1/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash
```

After it finishes, restart any open AI apps. Then use:

```text
Claude Code: /reload-plugins, then /hephaestus ontology
Codex:       /prompts:hephaestus-network, or the $hephaestus-network skill
Gemini CLI:  /extensions list or /commands list, then /hephaestus
Antigravity: reopen the workspace, then /hephaestus
Cursor:      /hephaestus-network (command + skill)
OpenCode:    /hephaestus-network
OpenClaw:    /skill hephaestus-network <request>
Hermes:      hephaestus-network skill (+ MCP, hermes/README.md)
Ollama/Gemma/DeepSeek local models: docs/local-models.md
```

Use the same command again to update to the packaged ref. To force a different
ref:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/main/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | HEPHAESTUS_REF=main bash
```

### Option A. Claude Code plugin

Open your normal OS terminal, not the Claude chat box, and run:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus --sparse .claude-plugin claude/plugins
claude plugin install hephaestus@agentlas-core-engine
```

Then open or restart Claude Code in the project you want to work on and type:

```text
/reload-plugins
/hephaestus ontology
```

If you already installed the old `agentlas-meta-agent` plugin and Claude says
`hephaestus` is not found, refresh the marketplace and replace the old plugin:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/v0.6.1/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash
```

`/hephaestus ontology` opens a local SaaS-style ontology dashboard for the
current project. The dashboard has a left navigation rail, an Obsidian-style
knowledge graph, source search, a GraphRAG query builder, a Memory Candidate
Queue, and copyable commands. It creates these files in that project only:

```text
.agentlas/ontology-inbox/
.agentlas/ontology-sources.json
.agentlas/ontology-runtime.sqlite
.agentlas/ontology-gui/index.html
```

It does not scan your home folder or sibling projects. Put approved company docs
inside `.agentlas/ontology-inbox/`, then run `/hephaestus ontology` again to
refresh the dashboard.

To create agents or teams after install:

```text
/hephaestus create a research agent for SEC filing analysis
/hephaestus create a customer support operations team
/hephaestus package this existing Claude agent into Agentlas architecture
```

Claude also supports `claude plugins ...` as an alias, but this README uses
`claude plugin ...` everywhere so the command shape stays consistent.

### Option B. Codex plugin

Open your normal OS terminal, not the Codex chat box, and run:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add agentlas-ai/Hephaestus --ref v0.6.1
codex plugin add hephaestus@agentlas-core-engine
```

Then open or restart Codex in the project you want to work on and type:

```text
/hephaestus ontology
```

If Codex still shows `agentlas-meta-agent`, refresh the marketplace and replace
the old plugin:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/v0.6.1/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash
```

The Codex OS-terminal CLI command is singular: `codex plugin`, not
`codex plugins`. Inside the Codex app, the slash command for the plugin browser
is plural: `/plugins`. After plugin install, `/hephaestus ontology` creates and
opens the same project-local dashboard with graph, sources, query, memory queue,
and command views:

```text
.agentlas/ontology-gui/index.html
To create agents or teams after install:

```text
/hephaestus create a self-evolving research agent
/hephaestus create a finance analyst team
/hephaestus package this existing Codex workspace into Agentlas architecture
```

Every generated or packaged Agentlas agent receives a global command during
creation. The final handoff must include `global_commands` for Claude Code,
Codex, Gemini CLI, generic `AGENTS.md` tools, and terminal use. For a team,
that public command routes to the orchestrator/HQ.

### Agentlas Cloud readiness

Run these local checks before uploading an existing agent to Agentlas Cloud or
publishing a clean copy to the Hub:

```bash
bin/hephaestus wizard ./some-agent --name instagram-operator
bin/hephaestus security scan ./some-agent --strict
bin/hephaestus runtime bundle ./some-agent
bin/hephaestus runtime read-agent-file ./some-agent AGENTS.md
bin/hephaestus field-test
```

The wizard creates `agentlas.json`, the scan writes
`.agentlas/security-scan.json`, and the runtime bundle uses manifest allowlists
instead of sending an entire ZIP to the model.

### Option C. Copy the files into a project

Use this if you are not installing the Claude/Codex plugin and just want the
repo package files in your current project. Open macOS Terminal, Linux terminal,
Windows Git Bash, or WSL in that project folder and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/v0.6.1/scripts/install.sh | bash
scripts/verify-package.sh
scripts/public_safety_check.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$zip = "$env:TEMP\hephaestus-v0.6.1.zip"
$extract = "$env:TEMP\hephaestus-v0.6.1"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/archive/refs/tags/v0.6.1.zip" -OutFile $zip
Remove-Item $extract -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Expand-Archive $zip -DestinationPath $extract -Force
$src = Get-ChildItem $extract -Directory | Select-Object -First 1
Get-ChildItem $src.FullName -Force | Copy-Item -Destination (Get-Location) -Recurse -Force
```

After file install, run the ontology GUI directly:

```bash
bin/hephaestus ontology
```

### Optional Claude Code in-chat plugin install

Use this only when you are already inside Claude Code and want to install from
the Claude chat UI instead of the OS terminal.

Claude Code chat:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus --sparse .claude-plugin claude/plugins
/plugin install hephaestus@agentlas-core-engine
/reload-plugins
/hephaestus ontology
```

Codex does not accept `/plugin marketplace add` inside the app. In Codex,
install from the OS terminal with `codex plugin ...`, then restart Codex and
use `/plugins` only to browse or enable installed plugins. After Hephaestus is
installed, run `/hephaestus ontology`.

If a Claude chat window does not show the new command after install, restart
Claude Code in that project.

## Visual Install Guide

Use the Claude slash-command image only when you are already inside Claude
Code. For Codex, install from the OS terminal; inside the Codex app, use
`/plugins` to browse installed plugins.

### Claude Code chat

Type these commands directly into Claude Code:

![Claude Code chat install flow](assets/install-claude-code-chat.svg)

### Claude CLI from your OS terminal

Use this path when the `claude` command is available in your shell:

![Claude CLI install flow](assets/install-claude-cli.svg)

### Codex app plugin browser

Use this only after the OS-terminal `codex plugin ...` install:

![Codex app plugin browser](assets/install-codex-chat.svg)

### Codex Desktop or IDE Extension

Use this path when Codex shows a Plugins settings screen:

![Codex Desktop settings install flow](assets/install-codex-desktop-settings.svg)

### Codex CLI from your OS terminal

Use this path when the `codex` command is available in your shell:

![Codex CLI install flow](assets/install-codex-cli.svg)

## What You Open And Where You Type

| Task | Open this | Type here |
|---|---|---|
| Download Desktop | Browser | `https://agentlas.cloud/desktop` or the OS download command |
| Install `agentlas` CLI | Agentlas Desktop | Settings -> Use from the terminal -> Install CLI |
| Run Agentlas Terminal | OS terminal | `agentlas list`, `agentlas run ...` |
| Install Claude plugin by slash command | Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add ...`, `/plugin install ...`, `/reload-plugins` |
| Install Claude plugin by shell | OS terminal | `claude plugin marketplace add ...`, `claude plugin install ...` |
| Browse installed Codex plugins | Codex app | `/plugins` |
| Install Codex plugin by shell | OS terminal | `codex plugin marketplace add ...`, `codex plugin add ...` |

## After Install: How To Actually Use It (3 minutes)

Installation also registers the **agentlas Hub MCP** for you — Claude Code gets it
from the bundled `.mcp.json`, Codex/Antigravity from the one-touch install script,
and Gemini CLI from the extension manifest. No separate MCP setup needed.

### 1. Where do I type?

| Runtime | Open it | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Type `claude` in your OS terminal (or open the desktop app) | `/hephaestus`, or just plain language |
| Codex | Type `codex` in your OS terminal (or open the Codex app) | `/hephaestus` |
| Gemini CLI | Type `gemini` in your OS terminal | `/hephaestus` |
| Antigravity | Open your workspace | `/hephaestus` |

`/hephaestus` is for **building** agents. To **find and pull in** agents that already
exist, talk to the MCP in plain language as below.

### 2. MCP tools are used in plain language, not commands

You never call MCP tools directly. Just say what you want and the AI picks the
right tool.

| Say this | Tool that runs underneath |
|---|---|
| "Find an agentlas agent that helps with ASO" | `agentlas.search` |
| "What agents are on the agentlas marketplace? Show them by category" | `marketplace.search_agents` |
| "Install that team into this project" | `agentlas.get_runtime_bundle` |
| "Show my agents" (sign-in required) | `cargo.*` |

When a feature needs sign-in for the first time, Hephaestus opens the default
browser and sends the user to the Agentlas/Google sign-in screen. After that,
the signed-in state carries across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, and
other Hephaestus surfaces; users do not paste or manage anything.

To verify the registration:

| Runtime | Check |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Type `/mcp` in chat — you should see the `agentlas` server and its tools |
| Codex | `codex mcp list` in the terminal; private agent features should open browser sign-in on first use |
| Gemini CLI | `/mcp` in chat or `gemini mcp list` in the terminal |

### 3. When you don't know what agents exist

- Just ask: **"What agents are on agentlas?"**, **"Recommend agents that could help me launch my app"** — the search tools take it from there.
- Browse on the web: [agentlas.cloud/marketplace](https://agentlas.cloud/marketplace)
- Register the MCP manually in other clients (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, ...): [agentlas.cloud/mcp](https://agentlas.cloud/mcp)

## What It Builds

Hephaestus leaves behind a repository that another runtime can inspect, install, verify, and keep improving.

| You ask for | It routes to | You get |
|---|---|---|
| "Make one agent that does X" | `10-single-agent-builder` | One installable worker with skills, memory contracts, runtime adapters, and verification |
| "Make a team/company for this workflow" | `20-multi-agent-team-builder` | A multi-role operating team with HQ, PM Soul, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, eval, QA, and handoffs |
| "Package this existing agent/repo/workspace" | `30-agentlas-packager` | A cleaned Agentlas package for Desktop import, terminal use, Codex, Claude, Gemini, or public GitHub release |

All three modes must create `.agentlas/global-commands.json` and report the
exact global command after generation. The user should not have to infer how to
run the new agent.

Generated or repaired packages can include:

```text
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
GEMINI.md
agent.md
agents/
skills/
modes/
.agentlas/
.agentlas/global-commands.json
.agents/
.claude/
.gemini/
.gemini/commands/
codex/
schemas/
templates/
scripts/verify-package.sh
scripts/public_safety_check.sh
```

## Architecture

The public core is the architecture and foldering contract. Runtime-specific folders are adapters over the same core, not separate sources of truth.

| Public contract | What it does |
|---|---|
| Mode auto-detection | Chooses `single-agent-creator`, `team-builder`, or `agentlas-packager` before generation |
| Clarify question loop | Asks only package-shaping questions that affect runtime, public boundary, tools, or safety |
| Global command registry | Adds `.agentlas/global-commands.json`, runtime command files, and the final `global_commands` handoff |
| `.agentlas` auto-activation | Lets local runtimes seed project memory, sitemap/task-bias, Memory Tickets, and vault references |
| Skill lifecycle registry | Ships candidate skill metadata, empty trial ledgers, and Curator decision ledgers before first-class recall |
| Super Ontology candidate layer | Seeds public-safe graph and memory governance files for source lineage, privacy, task coverage, causality, consensus, repair, and reflexive feedback checks |
| Production Ontology Runtime | Ingests local sources into SQLite/FTS chunks, entities, relations, GraphRAG retrieval, Memory Curator tickets, and Agent Working Memory cache |
| Ontology-backed agent overlay | Routes corpus-dependent requests (`ontology_backed: true`) so builders activate the runtime, wire a retrieval-first workflow, and set `loop_policy` per risk tier |
| Rule-based contract injection | `.agentlas/contract-injection-map.json` injects only the governance contracts matching the agent's task traits instead of all 26 |

The default export state is conservative. Generated skills are searchable candidate metadata, not automatically promoted runtime behavior. A local Curator must see execution evidence, sealed holdout or replay proof, rollback coverage, and workspace policy approval before a skill becomes first-class recall.

### Production Ontology Runtime

For knowledge-heavy personal or company agents, Hephaestus now ships a real local-first ontology runtime under `ontology/` with the executable CLI `bin/ontology`. It turns approved files into an agent-readable source archive, chunk store, full-text index, vector index, ontology graph, GraphRAG result, Memory Curator candidate ticket, and Agent Working Memory cache.

**Hephaestus Network MCP capabilities:**

- **`hephaestus_hub_invoke` MCP tool.** Hephaestus Network now has a real Hub invocation surface, not only Hub candidate search. The tool skips local routing, calls Agentlas Hub MCP (`marketplace.search_agents`, `agentlas.get_runtime_bundle`, `agentlas.resolve_plugins`), and writes execution receipts under `~/.agentlas/networking/ledgers/executions.jsonl`.
- **Hub-only local bypass.** `hub_only` routing and Hub invocation can be used with `local_inventory: []` and `reject_paid_slug: true` so local Paid/Free/plugin cards are not selected or executed.
- **Global Agentlas memory bootstrap.** Hub invocation can create the missing shared files under `~/.agentlas/` (`memory-map.json`, `project-soul-memory.md`, `invocation-ledger.jsonl`, etc.) and appends invocation evidence without storing raw prompts or secrets.
- **Installed-runtime verification.** The one-touch installer now verifies five runtime surfaces and keeps the neutral runner at `~/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus`.

**Ontology runtime upgrades:**

- **First-party Korean document parsing.** HWPX is parsed as ZIP/XML with paragraph and table spans, and legacy HWP5 `.hwp` is parsed directly from CFB `FileHeader` and `BodyText/Section*` streams. No GPL/AGPL parser or `hwp5txt` binary is required. Encrypted or distribution-protected HWP stays blocked with an explicit parser status.
- **CJK search works.** The tokenizer now emits character bigrams for Korean/Japanese/Chinese runs and the FTS index uses the `trigram` tokenizer, so Korean corpora (proposals, contracts, and quotes in HWPX and Office formats) are searchable with zero install. Existing databases migrate and re-index automatically on first open.
- **RRF hybrid ranking.** Full-text and vector rankings fuse via Reciprocal Rank Fusion instead of mixed-scale fixed weights, on a bounded candidate pool (no full-corpus Python scan).
- **Host-LLM search hooks (optional, zero extra cost).** A host CLI runtime (Claude Code / Codex) can inject query-expansion and rerank hooks — no embedding API or key needed. Chunks scoped private/confidential are never passed to cloud hooks; the gate is enforced inside the search pipeline.
- **Chunk overlap.** Sliding windows now overlap 15% so context is not cut at chunk boundaries.
- **Ontology-backed agent mode.** Builders can generate retrieval-first, citation-attached agents (see `modes/ontology-backed-agent.md` and the golden-path reference in `examples/ontology-proposal-agent/`), with governance contracts injected by rule and `loop_policy` (none / self-correct / verified) derived from task risk.
- **Adapter drift gate + MCP surface check.** `scripts/sync-adapters.sh --check` keeps runtime adapters byte-identical to the canonical core, and `scripts/verify-mcp-surface.sh` guards the `agentlas` MCP registration contract across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Antigravity.

The Super Ontology files under `.agentlas/` remain the safety/governance layer. They define the source-lineage, privacy, task-coverage, causal, consensus, and memory-write gates around the runtime. The runtime is the implementation layer.

In Agentlas Terminal and Desktop, the same runtime is exposed as
`agentlas ontology`; in plugin-hosted tools, use `/hephaestus ontology`.
The runtime never scans your home folder or sibling projects; it only ingests
explicit approved paths, registered sources, and project-local inbox files.

Supported ingest formats:

| Format | Status |
|---|---|
| `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.csv` | parsed |
| `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx` | parsed through OpenXML adapters |
| `.pdf` | parsed through `pdftotext` when installed |
| `.hwpx` | parsed through the first-party HWPX ZIP/XML adapter with paragraph and table spans |
| images/OCR | parsed through macOS Vision OCR or Tesseract when available |
| `.hwp` binary | parsed through the first-party HWP5 CFB/BodyText adapter; encrypted or distribution-protected files are blocked |
| unknown extensions | `unsupported_pending_adapter` |

The storage default is SQLite at `.agentlas/ontology-runtime.sqlite`, ignored by Git. The schema includes `sources`, `source_lineage`, `chunks`, `chunk_fts`, `entities`, `entity_aliases`, `relations`, `memory_candidates`, `memory_candidate_events`, `working_memory`, `runtime_adapters`, and `schema_migrations`.

Basic local run:

```bash
bin/ontology ingest examples/ontology-corpus --scope internal
bin/ontology query "Project Helios Memory Curator" --agent verifier
bin/ontology graph entity "Project Helios"
bin/ontology memory candidates
bin/ontology working-memory read --agent verifier
bin/ontology verify
```

The query response includes relevant chunks, related entities, relation edges, evidence refs, source spans, confidence, Memory Curator candidate suggestions, and optional Agent Working Memory writes. It is not a vector-only result.

The runtime stack is layered:

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| Source archive and chunk store | Stores source metadata, checksum, source type, parser status, version, privacy scope, lineage, chunks, source spans, token estimates, and checksums |
| Search index | SQLite FTS5 (trigram, CJK-capable) plus local hashing vectors with CJK bigram tokens, fused with RRF; optional host-LLM query expansion/rerank hooks; no API key is needed and source text stays local |
| Ontology graph | Stores entities, aliases, relations, confidence, evidence chunks, observed/valid time fields, source lineage, and active/stale/deprecated status |
| GraphRAG retriever | Returns text evidence and graph slices together |
| Memory Curator bridge | Creates candidate tickets only; direct durable memory writes are blocked |
| Agent Working Memory | Per-agent hot cache with task/run scope, source refs, confidence, importance, TTL, last-used time, and invalidation reason |

Memory Curator flow:

```bash
bin/ontology memory candidates
bin/ontology memory decide <ticket-id> approve --reason "Curator accepted source-backed fact"
bin/ontology memory decide <ticket-id> quarantine --reason "Needs source owner review"
```

Approval records review state but still does not write durable memory. The Memory Curator owns durable promotion. Agent Working Memory is intentionally a cache, not a source of truth.

See [`docs/ontology-runtime.md`](docs/ontology-runtime.md) for the schema, adapter behavior, storage commands, and verification coverage.

## Why Agentlas Desktop And Terminal Make It Better

Desktop and Terminal make this package useful beyond a static prompt:

- Desktop shows the agent/team structure, local projects, Apps, vault references, and runtime choices.
- Terminal runs the same package from a shell with `agentlas`.
- The built-in Core Engine Meta-Agent path means fresh Desktop/Terminal installs can create or package agents without a separate standalone plugin install.
- Standalone Claude/Codex install is still useful when you want this package directly inside those runtimes.

## Compare

| Compared with | Their strength | What Hephaestus adds |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI / Codex | Strong models and coding terminal | Portable repo contracts, `.agentlas` memory/package files, skills, schemas, runtime adapters, and public verification |
| Claude / Claude Code | Strong reasoning and Claude-native workflows | Claude support without becoming Claude-only; Codex, Gemini, Desktop, terminal, and `AGENTS.md` stay aligned |
| OpenClaw | Local identity and workspace agent loop | Visible role folders, Agentlas package contracts, public-safety checks, Desktop import, vault references, and install surfaces |
| Hermes | Persona and memory-centered local agent runtime | PM Soul, Memory Tickets, sitemap/task-bias, policy/eval/QA, and skill lifecycle evidence as files |

OpenAI and Claude are model/runtime surfaces. OpenClaw and Hermes are local-agent experiences. Hephaestus is the package layer that makes agents portable, inspectable, installable, and publishable.

## Use It

Single agent:

```text
/meta-agent Create a research agent for SEC filing analysis.
Package it for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, and Agentlas Desktop.
```

Multi-agent team:

```text
Use Hephaestus.
Build a customer-support operations team with PM Soul, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, QA, eval, and public-safe release checks.
```

Package an existing workspace:

```text
Package this local OpenClaw/Hermes-style workspace into Agentlas architecture.
Keep private notes, machine paths, raw logs, and secrets out of the public repo.
```
