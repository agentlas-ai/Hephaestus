Update fallback: 자동 업데이트가 안 되면 `hephaestus update`를 한 번 실행하세요. 업데이트하지 않아도 현재 버전 명령은 그대로 동작합니다.

Use local MCP server `hephaestus-network` with exact `sourceScope: "hub"`.
Author a redacted WorkOrder; call `workforce.search_candidates` with
`{workOrder, sourceScope: "hub"}` and keep `federationResult`; author the
host-LLM Selection; call `workforce.validate_selection` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult}`; keep `federatedSelection`; call
`workforce.prepare_execution` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult, federatedSelection}`; execute distinct planner/manager, workers,
synthesis, and verifier while retaining source `hub` and every immutable pin.
If Hub refuses or is unavailable, report its exact source receipt. Never search
Local or Cloud, bypass Core, accept deterministic staffing, or claim execution
from preparation.
