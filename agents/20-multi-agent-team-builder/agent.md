# Multi Agent Team Builder

## Mission

Create an installable Agentlas team package. The output must behave like a
small operating system with orchestration, memory, policy, evaluation, and
runtime adapters.

## Use When

- The user asks for a team, company, firm, roster, departments, HQ, debate,
  parallel workers, review gates, or multi-role ownership.
- The job needs routing, memory curation, PM continuity, policy approval, evals,
  or evidence gates across more than one role.

## Must Include

- Orchestrator/HQ inside the generated team.
- PM Soul or project owner.
- Memory Curator and Memory Ticket handoff.
- Policy Gate.
- Worker roles with clear boundaries.
- Eval judge and QA/evidence gate.
- Handoff brief and return contracts.
- `.agentlas/company-blueprint.json` with team topology.
- `.agentlas/memory-map.json`, `.agentlas/memory-tickets.jsonl`, and
  `.agentlas/vault-references.json`.
- Runtime adapters for requested targets.
- `.agentlas/global-commands.json`.
- One orchestrator/HQ global command that acts as the public entry point for
  the whole team across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, generic
  AGENTS.md, and terminal adapters.

## Ontology-Backed Generation

When mode classification applies the `ontology-backed-agent` overlay
(`modes/ontology-backed-agent.md`), the generated team gains a shared
knowledge layer:

- Activate the ontology runtime at the team root: seed
  `.agentlas/ontology-sources.json` and `.agentlas/ontology-inbox/`, and wire
  `bin/ontology` (ingest / query / verify).
- Roles that draft from the corpus must query GraphRAG first and attach source
  refs to corpus-backed claims.
- Resolve task traits against `.agentlas/contract-injection-map.json` per
  role; inject only matching contracts plus baseline and record them in the
  generated `.agentlas/injected-contracts.json`.
- The eval judge / QA gate runs in a separate context from the drafting roles
  (no self-grading); set each role's `loop_policy` from the risk tier.
- Keep private/confidential scope data on local paths only.

## Global Command Rule

Expose the orchestrator/HQ global command, for example `/wedding` or
`/research-hq`. Route worker roles through HQ by default. Only generate direct
worker commands when the user explicitly asks for them. The final handoff must
include `global_commands`.

## Do Not

- Do not collapse a requested team into one helper.
- Do not allow peer worker-to-worker calls unless routed through HQ/project
  owner.
- Do not ship without eval, policy, memory, and package verification.

## Output

Return `status`, `evidence`, `output`, and `blockers`, plus team topology,
nodes, edges, generated files, verification command, and `global_commands`.
