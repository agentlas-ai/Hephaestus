# Agentlas Core Engine Meta-Agent Team

This repository is a portable three-agent meta-agent team. Use it to create or
package Agentlas-compatible single agents and multi-agent teams for Codex,
Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes
Agent, Ollama-served local models (Gemma, DeepSeek — see
`docs/local-models.md`), and `AGENTS.md`-compatible runtimes.

## Source Of Truth

  generated packages.
- Public install surfaces: `codex/`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `antigravity/`, and
  `scripts/`.

Runtime-specific folders are adapters. They must mirror the canonical core, not
become separate sources of truth.

## Operating Loop

1. Run the public mode classifier (`skills/mode-classification/SKILL.md`) and
   classify the request as one of:
   - create one single agent;
   - create a multi-agent team;
   - package or repair an existing local/external agent or team.
2. If required details would change the package, run the clarify loop
   (`skills/clarify-question-loop/SKILL.md`) before generating files.
3. Route to exactly one core team member:
   - `10-single-agent-builder`;
   - `20-multi-agent-team-builder`;
   - `30-agentlas-packager`.
4. Inspect current files before making claims. Prefer real files over remembered
   assumptions.
5. Emit or repair the smallest useful Agentlas package.
6. Add the required architecture contracts for the selected mode.
7. Add thin adapters for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and
   optional Cursor.
8. Assign one canonical global command during creation, write
   `.agentlas/global-commands.json`, add runtime command files or aliases, and
   keep team worker roles routed through the orchestrator/HQ command unless the
   user explicitly asks for direct worker commands.
9. Add `.agentlas` seed files when the generated or packaged output needs local
   continuity; local runtimes may auto-activate them using
   `skills/agentlas-auto-activation/SKILL.md`.
10. Add or repair `agentlas.json` so Agentlas Cloud can compile a runtime
   bundle, gate lazy file reads, and separate private sync from public clean
   copies.
11. Add skill lifecycle metadata using
   `skills/skill-lifecycle-promotion/SKILL.md` when the package contains
   reusable skills.
12. Verify with `scripts/verify-package.sh`.
13. For ontology runtime changes, also verify with
    `scripts/verify-ontology-runtime.sh`.
14. For long-running or multi-file execution work, apply
    `docs/robustness-protocol.md`: scope lock, plan lock, evidence loop,
    review gate, and final gate before claiming completion.

## Hephaestus Network Commands

`/hephaestus-network <request>` (alias `@Hephaestus <request>`, terminal
`hephaestus "<request>"`) routes a natural-language request through the
local-first router: explicit commands → project `.agentlas/routing-overrides.json`
→ local routing cards (`routing_ready`+ only) → Agentlas Hub fallback behind a
user approval → propose building a new agent. Plan-anchored composite requests
("기획부터 구현, QA까지") return `action: "pipeline"` — a multi-team stage plan
chained by the cards' `produces`/`consumes` artifact contracts; execute stages
in order behind per-stage approvals, handing artifacts through `handoff_dir`.
Honor the decision JSON exactly:
ask the `clarify_question` on `clarify`, surface `approval_request` before any
high-risk capability (file writes, cloud calls, payments, publishing, deletion,
private data export, external tools), never send raw prompts or local memory to
the Hub, and report the routing `receipt_id`. Generated and packaged repos must
include `.agentlas/routing-card.json` (see `schemas/routing-card.schema.json`);
cards below `routing_ready` are excluded from auto routing.

Hephaestus Network chooses the agent, team, plugin, or Hub bundle. The
Hephaestus Robustness Protocol governs execution after that route is selected:
it requires scope/plan locking, bounded evidence loops, review gates, and a
final completion gate for substantial work.

## Team Roles

- `10-single-agent-builder`: one installable self-evolving worker package.
- `20-multi-agent-team-builder`: multi-role team package with orchestrator/HQ,
  PM Soul, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, eval, QA, handoffs, memory, and runtime
  adapters.
- `30-agentlas-packager`: package or repair existing local/external agents and
  teams into Agentlas architecture for local use, Agentlas import, Codex plugin
  use, Claude adapter use, or open-source release.

PM Soul, Memory Curator, runtime adapters, sitemap/task-bias, policy, eval, and
verification are generated architecture components. They are not extra members
of this meta-agent team.

## Output Contract

When asked to create, repair, or package an agent repo, return:

- `status`: completed, blocked, or needs_clarification.
- `evidence`: files inspected, commands run, and verification result.
- `output`: generated path, changed files, or exact design.
- `global_commands`: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, generic
  AGENTS.md, and terminal commands from `.agentlas/global-commands.json`.
- `blockers`: only blockers that require the user or external state.

Generated or packaged repos must include the relevant subset of:

- visible `agents/` and `skills/` folders;
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`;
- `.agentlas/mode-map.json`;
- `.agentlas/agent-card.json`;
- `.agentlas/company-blueprint.json`;
- `.agentlas/global-commands.json`;
- `agentlas.json`;
- `.agentlas/memory-map.json`;
- `.agentlas/memory-tickets.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/vault-references.json`;
- `.agentlas/local-credentials.map.json` plus `.env.example`, `signing/README.md`,
  and `credentials/README.md` when local credentials are required;
- `.agentlas/skill-registry.json`;
- `.agentlas/skill-trials.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/curator-decisions.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-contract.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-open-world-coverage.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-consensus-coordination.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-task-coverage.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-contextual-flow.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-causal-impact.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-assurance-case.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-knowledge-homeostasis.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-adversarial-provenance.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-epistemic-calibration.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-semantic-alignment.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-resilience-control.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-invariant-verification.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-observability-telemetry.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-objective-proxy-validity.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-stakeholder-preference-governance.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-normative-authority-drift.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-side-effect-containment.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-source-lineage-version.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-entity-identity-resolution.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-temporal-state-transition.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-capability-delegation-authority.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-privacy-confidentiality-boundary.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-strategic-incentive-compatibility.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-reflexive-feedback-stability.json`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-replays.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-evidence.jsonl`;
- `.agentlas/super-ontology-memory-bridge.jsonl`;
- runtime adapters and smoke-test docs;
- global command adapter files such as `.claude/commands/<slug>.md`,
  `codex/plugins/<package-id>/commands/<slug>.md`, and
  `gemini/extension/commands/<slug>.toml` with optional
  `.gemini/commands/<slug>.toml` fallback;
- production ontology runtime code, CLI, tests, and sample corpus when the
  package needs local-first knowledge storage, search, GraphRAG, Memory Curator
  bridge tickets, or Agent Working Memory;
- install or verification scripts;
- public-safety notes if the output is meant for GitHub.

Cloud-ready packages must pass the local setup wizard contract: `agentlas.json`
exists, the Hephaestus security scan is `PASS` or reviewable `WARN`, the
runtime bundle compiles from manifest allowlists, and denied paths never expose
secret-like values.

## Mode Rules

`single-agent-creator` produces one installable worker package. It can include
multiple skills, setup guides, memory architecture, research refresh, and
self-evolution proposals, but it must not inflate the request into a company,
HQ roster, or swarm. It must expose one global command for the worker and report
that command to the user after creation.

`team-builder` produces a multi-role team package. It must include a root
orchestrator/HQ, PM Soul or project owner, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, worker
roles, eval judge, QA/evidence gate, handoff rules, runtime adapters, memory
architecture, and release checks. It must expose the orchestrator/HQ global
command as the public entry point; worker roles stay behind HQ routing unless
direct worker commands were explicitly requested.

`agentlas-packager` repairs or converts an existing agent/team into the Agentlas
shape. It adds canonical core files, `.agentlas` contracts, runtime adapters,
schemas, manifest, install scripts, global command registry, verification, and
public/private cleanup.

## Memory Preflight

Before substantial work:

1. Read `.agentlas/memory-map.json` if present.
2. Load only task-relevant memory.
3. Label remembered facts as `verified`, `memory_derived`, `inferred`, or
   `stale_check_needed`.
4. Re-check drift-prone facts against current files or sources.

Workers may emit `## Memory Events`. The runtime or orchestrator wraps those
events into Memory Tickets before durable curation.

Skills may also emit `## Skill Trial Events`. Those events are lifecycle
evidence for candidate/trial/first-class review and must not be mixed with
Memory Events. Generated packages keep all skills at `candidate` tier until a
local Curator approves promotion.

## Safety Rules

- Never store secrets, API keys, tokens, key material, credential file contents,
  raw logs, or full transcripts in generated repos or memory.
- Real credential values may be saved only in local gitignored project stores
  (`.env`, `.env.local`, `signing/`, `credentials/`) or a local keychain/vault.
  Generated public packages may include only placeholders, guide files, and a
  value-free `.agentlas/local-credentials.map.json`.
- Generated project memory must keep a `Local Credential Index (read first)`
  section near the top. For deploy, release, store, billing, auth, API, or
  cloud work, check that section and `.agentlas/local-credentials.map.json`
  before reporting missing credentials.
- Do not copy private local research folders into public output.
- Do not call runtime adapters canonical.
- Ask for explicit approval before destructive file actions, production deploys,
  paid API spend, permission widening, or public publishing.
- Public packages must pass `scripts/verify-package.sh` and
  `scripts/public_safety_check.sh` before release.
