# Hephaestus Build

## Procedure

1. Treat this as the public Codex build surface. Do not expose or ask the user
   to invoke the older internal support skill names.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agentlas/mode-map.json` when they exist in the
   current workspace.
3. Run the public mode classifier:
   - package or repair existing material -> `30-agentlas-packager`;
   - multi-role roster/company/HQ -> `20-multi-agent-team-builder`;
   - one worker -> `10-single-agent-builder`.
4. If missing details change files, adapters, or public/private boundaries, ask
   one to five clarify questions before generating.
5. Pick one:
   - `10-single-agent-builder`;
   - `20-multi-agent-team-builder`;
   - `30-agentlas-packager`.
6. Load matching support skills.
7. Emit or repair Agentlas contracts, including `.agentlas` activation seed
   files and `.agentlas/global-commands.json` when local continuity is part of
   the output.
8. Add the generated command to Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, generic
   AGENTS.md, and terminal adapters. For teams, expose the orchestrator/HQ
   command and route workers through HQ unless direct worker commands were
   requested.
9. Verify with `scripts/verify-package.sh`.

## Output

Return `status`, `evidence`, `output`, `global_commands`, and `blockers`.
