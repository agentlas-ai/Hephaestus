# Hephaestus Cloud Workforce

Raw request: `$ARGUMENTS`

Use MCP server `hephaestus-network` and exact `sourceScope: "cloud"`. Author a
redacted `agentlas.workforce-work-order.v1`, call
`workforce.search_candidates` with `{workOrder, sourceScope: "cloud"}` and keep
the response as `federationResult`. Author the final
`agentlas.workforce-selection.v1` yourself, call
`workforce.validate_selection` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult}`, keep its response as `federatedSelection`, then call
`workforce.prepare_execution` with
`{workOrder, candidateSet: federationResult.candidateSet, selection,
federationResult, federatedSelection}`. Require every row to retain source `cloud` plus
its exact release/package/content/runtime/permission/context identity.

Run planner/manager, selected workers, synthesis, and verifier as distinct
invocations with artifact handoffs and preserve Team graphs. If owner auth or
Cloud is unavailable, report `source_unavailable` with the Core receipt. Never
search Local or public Hub, invoke legacy routing, accept a deterministic
picker, or treat a prepared bundle as execution proof.
