# Clarify Question Loop

Ask only questions that change the generated package, runtime adapter, safety
boundary, or public/private release decision.

For `/hep-build` creation or behavior-changing packaging, this is not a
substitute for the Builder Interview and Research Gate in
`docs/builder-interview-research-gate.md`. Run that gate first: ask an 8-12
question first batch, research similar agent repositories or comparables and
academic/professional theory, then use this clarify loop only for the remaining
narrow ambiguities.

## Procedure

1. Classify the current best mode.
2. Identify missing facts that would change files or safety.
3. Ask one to five short questions, preferably three. If more than five
   functional-quality questions remain, return to the Builder Interview and
   Research Gate instead of pretending the package is ready.
4. Do not ask for secrets. Ask for secret names or setup boundaries instead.
5. After answers arrive, re-run mode classification if needed.
6. Generate or repair the package using the answers and list assumptions.

## Default Questions

- Which runtime targets should be supported?
- Is this local-only, private-team, public open-source, or marketplace output?
- What tools, APIs, files, or services must it use?
- What should count as success?
- What must it never read, write, publish, or spend?
