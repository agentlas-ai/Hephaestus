# Architecture

Agentlas Core Engine Meta-Agent Team packages the common operating structure
behind Agentlas-style agent creation and packaging as a Markdown-first repo.

## Meta-Agent Team

```text
User request
  -> root meta-agent router
  -> one of:
       10-single-agent-builder
       20-multi-agent-team-builder
       30-agentlas-packager
  -> Agentlas architecture contracts
  -> runtime adapters
  -> verification
```

## Three Core Agents

- `10-single-agent-builder`: creates one installable worker package. It can add
  self-evolution, research refresh, memory architecture, and runtime adapters
  without turning the output into a team.
- `20-multi-agent-team-builder`: creates a team package with orchestrator/HQ,
  PM Soul, Memory Curator, Policy Gate, workers, eval judge, QA/evidence gate,
  handoffs, memory, and runtime adapters.
- `30-agentlas-packager`: takes existing local or external agents/teams and
  repairs them into the Agentlas architecture, including public plugin and
  one-line installer surfaces when requested.

## Canonical Core

## Public Runtime Contracts

Three runtime behaviors are public contracts here, not private product code:

- Mode classifier: choose `single-agent-creator`, `team-builder`, or
  `agentlas-packager` before generation.
- Clarify question loop: ask one to five package-shaping questions when the
  mode, runtime target, public boundary, tools, or safety constraints are
  unclear.
- `.agentlas` auto-activation: local runtimes may create or merge public
  `.agentlas` seed files after explicit activation or repeated meaningful work
  in the same folder.
- Skill lifecycle registry: generated packages may ship export-only candidate
  skill metadata, trial evidence ledgers, and Curator decision ledgers. Runtime
  first-class recall stays off until local Curator review and workspace policy
  approve it.
- Super Ontology candidate contract: generated packages may ship export-only
  adaptive knowledge governance metadata, open-world coverage, consensus coordination, task coverage, contextual-flow,
  causal-impact metadata, assurance-case metadata, knowledge-homeostasis
  metadata, adversarial-provenance metadata, epistemic-calibration metadata,
  semantic-alignment metadata, resilience-control metadata,
  invariant-verification metadata, replay ledgers, and promotion
  evidence ledgers. Runtime graph
  writes, cross-context information flows, relation-as-action jumps, broad
  safety claims, stale or desynced knowledge use, hostile-source promotion, and
  uncalibrated answers or writes, and unreviewed term/schema/ontology merges
  stay off until shadow/canary replay, rollback, homeostasis review,
  adversarial-provenance review, epistemic-calibration review,
  semantic-alignment review, resilience-control review, invariant-verification
  review, and sync review approve a later phase.

## Generated Architecture Components

The following concepts are not separate meta-agent team members. They are
contracts that the three builders generate or repair inside output packages:

- PM Soul or project owner.
- Memory Curator and Memory Tickets.
- Skill lifecycle registry, trial evidence, and Curator promotion decisions.
- Super Ontology candidate contract, open-world coverage, consensus coordination, task coverage, contextual flow, causal
  impact, assurance cases, knowledge homeostasis, adversarial provenance,
  epistemic calibration, semantic alignment, resilience control, invariant verification, replay evidence, and promotion
  evidence.
- Sitemap and task bias.
- LLM runtime architecture.
- Policy Gate.
- Eval judge and QA/evidence gate.
- Thin runtime adapters.
- Public-safety and install verification.

## Runtime Adapters

Adapters translate the same core into each runtime:

- Codex: `codex/marketplace.json` and
  `codex/plugins/agentlas-core-engine-meta-agent/`.
- Claude Code: `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`.
- Gemini CLI: `GEMINI.md` and `.gemini/GEMINI.md`.
- Generic AGENTS.md tools: root `AGENTS.md`.

Adapters should not contain private logic that is missing from the canonical
core.

## Packaging Flow

```text
existing prompt / agent / team / repo / zip
  -> Agentlas Packager
  -> inspect current structure
  -> classify single-agent or team package
  -> add AGENTS.md canonical core
  -> add .agentlas contracts
  -> add runtime adapters
  -> remove private or unsafe material from public output
  -> verify package
```

## Public Packaging Rule

A public package should look intentional at first glance:

- `README.md` explains the purpose.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` explains the system.
- `agents/` shows the three meta-agent team roles.
- `modes/` shows the three work modes.
- `skills/` shows reusable procedures.
- `schemas/` makes contracts explicit.
- `scripts/verify-package.sh` proves the package shape.
