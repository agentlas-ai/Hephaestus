# Changelog

## Unreleased

No unreleased changes yet.

## v0.7.9 - 2026-06-18

- Hardened installer command refresh for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity,
  Cursor, and OpenCode: stale command files and old symlinks are removed before
  the current command files are copied.
- This prevents older autocomplete entries such as `0-7-4` or retired
  `agentlas-*` support commands from surviving after an update.

## v0.7.8 - 2026-06-18

- Restored Super Ontology candidate-only sync invariants for consensus
  coordination and capability delegation authority: both remain AO
  runtime-enforced seed contracts, but public seeds cannot self-promote into
  runtime authority.
- `agentlas-architecture-sync` now passes again across public core, Web,
  Desktop/terminal, AppBridge, and Super Ontology candidate checks.

## v0.7.7 - 2026-06-18

- Added multilingual intent expansion for `/hephaestus-search`, so broad
  Korean prompts such as "시장 리포트 써야 하는데 쓸만한 에이전트 찾아줘"
  retry with high-signal market/research/report tokens when the Hub asks for
  clarification or returns no candidates.
- Search sections now report fallback metadata and still include candidate
  descriptions and per-agent `why` explanations without invoking agents.

## v0.7.6 - 2026-06-18

- Added power-user `/hephaestus-search` and `/hephaestus-call` surfaces across
  Claude, Codex prompts, Gemini, Antigravity, Cursor, OpenCode, terminal, and
  the local MCP server.
- `hephaestus-search` returns separate top-10 sections for the signed-in
  user's Agentlas Cloud packages and the public Agentlas Hub without invoking
  any agent.
- `hephaestus-call` prepares exactly named Hub/cloud agent slugs as BYOM
  runtime bundles and writes receipts; the host runtime still owns execution.
- Clarified that `/hephaestus-build ontology` is the local project
  knowledge/memory map, not the Hub marketplace search.
- Hardened the one-touch installer to prune stale visible command files,
  typo-command remnants, and old `0-7-4`/`0.7.4` plugin cache folders.

## v0.7.5 - 2026-06-18

- Moved the README first-run path to the top: copy-paste install prompt first,
  then the three commands, then example prompts.
- Updated the Agentlas web Hephaestus landing hero so the first visible product
  explanation is the three-command model: create, borrow, share.
- Pruned stale visible command surfaces from fresh installs and updates:
  `/hephaestus` and `/prompts:hephaestus` are no longer installed as chat
  autocomplete entries.
- Locked the Claude connector to command-only exposure: exactly
  `hephaestus-build`, `hephaestus-network`, and `hephaestus-cloud`. This
  prevents broad root-folder scans from showing version folders such as
  `0-7-4`, and prevents duplicate command+skill entries for the same names.
- Tightened the installer to clear stale Claude/Codex plugin caches before
  reinstalling, so older internal skills such as `mode-classification` or
  `team-builder-packaging` stop appearing after a refresh and app restart.

## v0.7.3 - 2026-06-18

- Added the clearer three-command user surface:
  `/hephaestus-build` for creation, `/hephaestus-network` for borrowing public
  Hub agents, and `/hephaestus-cloud` for using agents saved or shared through
  Agentlas Cloud. Legacy `/hephaestus` remains as a build alias.

## v0.7.2 - 2026-06-18

- Implemented the 0.7.2 Agent OS router surface: decisions now include
  `agent_os_router`, `task_force`, Local Operator `policy_decision`, and
  candidate-first `memory_playbook` metadata in both responses and receipts.
- Added Hub stage-wise temporary TF planning for composite Hub-only
  `/hephaestus-network` requests while preserving the existing `hub_candidates`
  action for caller compatibility.
- Wired pipeline planning to prefer Agent Ontology `produces`/`consumes` graph
  paths when available, falling back to routing-card artifact contracts.
- Added a Memory/Playbook control-plane registry and candidate queues under the
  local networking home; the router still cannot write durable/global memory
  directly.
- Added terminal aliases `hephaestus hephaestus-network` and the typo-tolerant
  `hephaestus hephaests-network` for the two-command user surface.
- Added the Stormbreaker execution fabric for Hephaestus Network `pipeline`
  decisions: required work packets, dependency groups, session hints, resume
  policy, and a final gate that blocks success until all required packets pass.
- Let MCP and CLI route callers pass a host session inventory so runtimes can
  schedule pipeline packets across active Codex, Claude, GLM, DeepSeek, Gemini,
  or local model sessions without moving execution into the router.
- Extended execution receipts with optional `pipeline_id`, `packet_id`,
  `session_id`, `parallel_group`, and parent receipt metadata.

## v0.7.1 - 2026-06-18

- Added the A2A Agent Card boundary: import external Agent Cards as pending
  alignment proposals, export public-safe cards at
  `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, and keep private/local fields out of public
  cards.
- Added caller-aware routing gates through CLI `route --caller` and MCP
  `hephaestus_route.caller_id`/`caller`, so agent-to-agent calls can be denied
  before a route is selected.
- Hardened A2A input handling: malformed JSON returns structured errors,
  non-object cards are rejected, and oversized skill lists are bounded.
- Made `ao lint` and `ao diff` return non-zero exits on invalid graphs or drift
  so CI and release gates cannot silently pass.
- Documented the architecture-sync handoff alongside the A2A upgrade and kept
  the broader ontology roadmap out of the release claim.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-06-16

- Published Hephaestus Stormbreaker as the robust execution contract with the
  v2 loop: scope lock, issue contract, failure memory, verifier-first plan,
  bounded evidence loop, adversarial review gate, outcome ledger, and final
  gate.
- Kept public benchmark claims inside the verified local operational robustness
  boundary.
