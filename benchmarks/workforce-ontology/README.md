# Agent Workforce Ontology difficult benchmark

`difficult-payment-platform.json` is the shared routing and execution benchmark
for frontier and local-model runs.  It deliberately needs five occupational
families and includes unrelated communities that must not be recalled.

An expected role family may be evidenced by a slot's required or optional
community declarations, or its required or optional skills. Optional expertise
remains a staffing preference rather than a hard eligibility requirement, and
each expected family must still map to a distinct role slot.

The fixture's forbidden communities are hidden negative-recall probes, not an
exhaustive list the host must copy into its WorkOrder. A probed community fails
the benchmark when a role slot positively requests it as required or optional,
or when a returned candidate belongs to it.

The fixture is pinned to Core ontology menu `awo:2026-07-15.2` and raw snapshot
SHA-256 `d6d30d45fe8d35fb785e165d1e80c6471a72436f0160c3933c21d4a31bf2fb32`.
The scorer fails closed when either the fixture or captured work-order and
candidate-set versions drift; it does not reinterpret an older menu.

`coverage-gap-codes-v1-vectors.json` pins the complete finite aggregate
`coverageGaps` vocabulary shared with Hub search. It includes the Desktop Qwen
response that exposed the contract drift and rejection vectors proving that an
unknown reason or candidate identity cannot cross the candidate-set boundary.

The host runtime must save one JSON object with these exact keys:

- `workOrder`
- `candidateSet`
- `selection`
- `selectionValidation`
- `selectionReceipt`
- `preparedExecution`
- `toolInventorySnapshot`
- `executionReceipt`

Run the scorer from the Core repository root:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/workforce-ontology/score_run.py /path/to/real-run.json
```

The scorer cannot create a selection or repair model output.  It requires the
three Hub MCP calls in order, two completed host-LLM leader turns, an accepted
frozen selection with no substitutions or history influence, structured
planner output without fallback, a v5 prepared execution context and digest-bound
permission/graph rows, distinct direct or nested worker invocations, completed
synthesis, and a passing verifier. A flat selected-team row without its declared
manager-plan, graph-worker, and manager-synthesis receipts fails.

`toolInventorySnapshot` is the exact local, private
`agentlas.workforce-tool-inventory.v1` artifact observed immediately before the
host-LLM binding decision. The scorer passes it separately as
`tool_inventory=run["toolInventorySnapshot"]`, recomputes its portable digest,
and rejects missing tools, wrong pair/policy/runtime scope, digest drift, or
grants not equal to the selected bindings. It must be retained beside the
benchmark receipt for historical replay and must never be sent to Hub.
