# Google Antigravity Adapter

Thin adapter that registers `/hephaestus` in [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google).
`AGENTS.md` at the repository root is the canonical source of truth; this folder
only carries the Antigravity-specific command surface.

## What Antigravity already reads

Antigravity natively loads, with no extra setup:

- `AGENTS.md` — cross-tool project rules and routing (canonical).
- `GEMINI.md` — Antigravity/Gemini context file.
- `.agents/skills/` — the reusable Agentlas skills.

## What this adapter adds

Antigravity registers a Markdown file in a `workflows/` directory as a chat
slash command. Hephaestus ships the `/hephaestus` workflow at two scopes:

| Scope | File | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global | `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/hephaestus.md` | `/hephaestus` in **every** Antigravity workspace. Installed by `scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh`. |
| Project | `.agents/workflows/hephaestus.md` | `/hephaestus` when this repo (or any project carrying the package) is open. Ships in the repo. |

`antigravity/workflows/hephaestus.md` is the canonical workflow body; the two
locations above mirror it (global install + in-repo project copy), the same way
the Gemini adapter ships both an extension command and a `~/.gemini/commands`
fallback.

## Install

From an OS terminal (not the Antigravity chat box):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentlas-ai/Hephaestus/v0.6.1/scripts/install-all-runtimes.sh | bash
```

Then reopen Antigravity and type `/hephaestus` (or `/hephaestus ontology`).
Antigravity shares the `~/.gemini/` home with the Gemini CLI, so this install
also keeps the Gemini extension and command in sync.
