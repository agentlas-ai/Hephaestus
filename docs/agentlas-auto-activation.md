# Agentlas Auto-Activation

Agentlas auto-activation is a public contract for local runtimes that want a
project folder to become an Agentlas-aware workspace.

It is not tied to one desktop app. Any local runtime may implement it with its
own storage, as long as it preserves the public behavior below.

## Purpose

When a user repeatedly works in the same folder, the runtime should make project
memory, sitemap/task-bias, PM Soul, and Memory Tickets available automatically.
One-off folders should stay untouched unless the user explicitly activates them.

## Activation Triggers

A runtime may activate when either condition is true:

- explicit activation: the user asks to activate Agentlas for this folder;
- repeated use: the same folder is used for meaningful work more than once.

The repeated-use threshold should be low enough to preserve continuity but not
so low that every temporary folder is modified. A common default is the second
visit.

## Files To Create

Create `.agentlas/` only when activation happens.

Recommended minimum:

```text
.agentlas/
├── project-soul-memory.md
├── sitemap.json
├── memory-map.json
├── memory-tickets.jsonl
├── vault-references.json
├── skill-registry.json
├── skill-trials.jsonl
├── curator-decisions.jsonl
├── super-ontology-contract.json
├── super-ontology-task-coverage.json
├── super-ontology-contextual-flow.json

├── super-ontology-semantic-alignment.json
├── super-ontology-replays.jsonl
├── super-ontology-evidence.jsonl
├── super-ontology-memory-bridge.jsonl
└── activation.json
```

If a package already includes `.agentlas/`, merge missing files without
overwriting user content.

## File Contracts

`project-soul-memory.md`

- Stores durable project decisions, constraints, risks, open loops, and current
  operating context.
- Must not store secrets, raw logs, or full transcripts.

`sitemap.json`

- Tracks project surfaces, status, risk, stale areas, evidence, and validation
  needs.
- Used by sitemap/task-bias logic to avoid only working on recent or obvious
  files.

`memory-map.json`

- Explains where memory belongs: user, team, project, agent repo, session, or
  discard.
- Points to sources, not secret values.

`memory-tickets.jsonl`

- Append-only queue of proposed durable memory events.
- Memory Curator reviews, redacts, deduplicates, and routes them.

`vault-references.json`

- References secret names or vault locations.
- Never stores secret values.

`activation.json`

- Public-safe activation metadata: schema version, activated time, runtime name,
  activation reason, and files created.

`skill-registry.json`

- Export-only candidate skill lifecycle metadata. First-class recall must stay
  disabled until local Curator review approves it.

`skill-trials.jsonl` and `curator-decisions.jsonl`

- Append-only ledgers for future trial evidence and Curator decisions. They are
  empty on activation unless a local runtime has real evidence to append.
- In portable packages this may start as `state: "seed"` so a local runtime can
  decide when to activate it.

`super-ontology-contract.json`

- Candidate-only adaptive knowledge governance metadata.
- Keeps `runtimeGraphWriteEnabled` and `zeroErrorClaim` false on export.
- Names the source-intake, evidence-packet, belief-ledger, knowledge-capsule,
  affordance-binding, task-coverage, contextual-flow, causal-impact,
  assurance-case, knowledge-homeostasis, adversarial-provenance,
  epistemic-calibration, semantic-alignment,
  promotion-readiness, replay, and sync-review gates.

`super-ontology-task-coverage.json`

- Export-only task coverage seed.
- Requires unknown requests to be classified by task family before graph slices,
  memory handoffs, tool bindings, external writes, physical actions, or training
  actions.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled until evidence mode, authority, review, and
  rollback are explicit.

`super-ontology-contextual-flow.json`

- Export-only contextual flow seed.
- Requires information flows to name sender, recipient, subject, attribute,
  purpose, authority, transmission principle, retention, and audit references
  before crossing personal, company, customer, public, regulated, agent, memory,
  tool, output, or public-export boundaries.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and blocks same-user context joins,
  tool-response oversharing, raw prompt memory, customer-data publication, and
  agent-internal trace exposure.

`super-ontology-causal-impact.json`

- Export-only causal impact seed.
- Requires relation-to-action jumps to name intervention target,
  counterfactual checks, adverse outcomes, observability, reversibility, blast
  radius, and rollback.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and blocks correlation-as-causation,
  physical action, training, and multi-agent shared-state writes without
  evidence and review.

`super-ontology-assurance-case.json`

- Export-only assurance case seed.
- Requires broad claims to name required evidence, observed evidence,
  validators, residual risk, blocked shortcuts, and rollback.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and treats perfection or zero-error language
  as a rejected overclaim.

`super-ontology-knowledge-homeostasis.json`

- Export-only knowledge health seed.
- Requires stale, contradictory, unsupported, drifting, parser-failed,
  privacy-incident, missing-evidence, user-corrected, or runtime-desynced
  knowledge to name signal, measurement, error budget, control decision,
  Memory Curator policy, public export policy, escalation, and rollback.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and blocks critical health signals from
  direct runtime writes.

`super-ontology-adversarial-provenance.json`

- Export-only hostile-source provenance seed.
- Requires uploads, web pages, emails, chats, tool responses, connector results,
  memory recalls, public repos, media assets, AppBridge route outputs,
  generated artifacts, and datasets to name source channel, attack vector,
  trust boundary, claimed authority, observed artifact, provenance evidence,
  integrity checks, instruction policy, retrieval policy, memory policy, tool
  policy, promotion decision, controls, forbidden shortcuts, and rollback.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and blocks prompt injection, poisoning,
  forged provenance, spoofed citations, hidden OCR instructions, tampered tool
  output, stale trusted-source replay, and unsigned release artifacts from
  becoming retrieval, memory, tool, or public seed authority.

`super-ontology-epistemic-calibration.json`

- Export-only uncertainty and abstention seed.
- Requires unknown work to name context type, claim type, uncertainty source,
  epistemic state, calibration signal, confidence band, risk tier, allowed
  output, evidence refs, memory policy, tool policy, public export policy, and
  rollback before answers, memory writes, tool actions, route sync, or public
  artifacts.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and blocks missing evidence, conflicting
  sources, low retrieval relevance, stale policies, noisy OCR, inconclusive
  tool output, model disagreement, wide judge intervals, and uncalibrated route
  sync from becoming confident answers or graph writes.

`super-ontology-semantic-alignment.json`

- Export-only term, schema, ontology, entity, relation, and glossary alignment
  seed.
- Requires proposed matches to name source context, artifact type, source term,
  target term, alignment intent, candidate relation, scope, ambiguity, semantic
  evidence, structural evidence, lexical evidence, negative evidence,
  validation checks, owner/curator controls, change policy, and rollback.
- Keeps runtime promotion disabled and blocks same labels, embedding similarity,
  generated labels, OCR labels, AppBridge route labels, source conflicts,
  missing unit compatibility, missing direction checks, and no-match cases from
  becoming graph or memory changes.

`super-ontology-replays.jsonl` and `super-ontology-evidence.jsonl`

- Empty append-only ledgers for future shadow/canary/rollback replay and
  promotion evidence.
- They do not make the ontology runtime-active by themselves.

`super-ontology-memory-bridge.jsonl`

- Empty append-only Memory Curator bridge ledger on export.
- Later runtimes may append redacted Memory Ticket bridge candidates only after
  raw prompts, secret values, private paths, and direct durable memory writes
  are blocked.

## Runtime Behavior

After activation, local runtimes should:

1. Read `.agentlas/project-soul-memory.md` before project-level claims.
2. Inject relevant memory context into agent prompts.
3. Ask workers to emit `## Memory Events` only for durable facts.
4. Route those events through Memory Tickets and Memory Curator.
5. Use `sitemap.json` to surface stale or under-validated work.
6. Keep activation idempotent and reversible.

## Safety Rules

- Never activate outside the selected project folder.
- Never overwrite existing `.agentlas` files without explicit approval.
- Never store credentials, API keys, raw logs, full transcripts, cookies,
  private keys, service-account files, or payment material.
- Never silently publish `.agentlas` memory from a private project.
- Keep runtime-specific state in runtime storage, not in public package files.

## Public Package Interaction

Generated or packaged Agentlas repos may include `.agentlas` seed files. A local
runtime that auto-activates the folder should treat those files as starting
contracts, not as private runtime state.
