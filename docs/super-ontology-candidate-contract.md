# Super Ontology Candidate Contract

The Super Ontology contract is a public-safe seed for adaptive knowledge
governance. It is not a claim that one ontology can perfectly cover every
future situation.

`super-ontology-contract.json`

- Describes the allowed ontology pipeline: source intake, evidence packets,
  belief ledger, knowledge capsules, affordance binding, open-world coverage,
  consensus coordination,
  task coverage,
  promotion readiness, replay drills, and rollback.
- Must set `runtimeGraphWriteEnabled` to `false` on export.
- Must set `zeroErrorClaim` to `false`.
- Must stay candidate-only until local runtime policy, shadow/canary replay,
  rollback, and sync review approve a later phase.

`super-ontology-replays.jsonl`

- Append-only shadow, canary, rollback, and sync-review replay evidence.
- Empty on export.
- Runtime agents may append records later only after the local Memory Curator,
  PM Soul, or architecture sync owner approves the evidence boundary.

`super-ontology-evidence.jsonl`

- Append-only promotion evidence rows.
- Empty on export.
- Evidence must identify the proof key, target surface, status, and summary
  without storing private logs, local paths, credentials, or raw source content.

`super-ontology-memory-bridge.jsonl`

- Append-only Memory Curator bridge candidates.
- Empty on export; the public core repo may carry a public-safe seed row for
  schema visibility.
- Rows must keep `durable_write_enabled=false` until Memory Curator, Policy
  Gate, PM Soul, or architecture sync review accepts the ticket.
- Rows must not store raw prompts, secret values, private paths, full
  transcripts, or direct durable memory writes.

`super-ontology-open-world-coverage.json`

  task is covered.

## Required Pipeline

The public contract names these layers:

1. source intake,
2. evidence packet,
3. belief ledger,
4. knowledge capsule,
5. affordance action binding,
6. open-world coverage contract,
7. consensus coordination contract,
8. task coverage contract,
9. contextual flow contract,
10. causal impact contract,
11. assurance case contract,
12. knowledge homeostasis contract,

28. architecture sync review.

## Hard Stops

Automatic promotion is blocked when:

- a candidate claims zero-error or universal completeness;
- a raw source would write directly into an ontology;
- a graph edge joins forbidden personal/company/public contexts;
- a downstream agent receives the whole graph instead of a task capsule;
- a tool call lacks argument provenance or user authority;
- a proposal/deck fixture is treated as proof that all future work is covered;
- a new world, task, modality, fault, authority, or write-surface combination
  would proceed without open-world fixture pressure, shadow replay, owner
  review, or sync review;
- a requested task family, affordance type, evidence mode, or rollback path is
  missing;
- a relation would be treated as causation, action permission, or intervention
  authority without counterfactual checks, blast radius, observability, and
  rollback;
- a broad claim lacks an assurance case, observed evidence, validator, residual
  risk, or rollback plan;
- a knowledge health signal overruns its error budget but still continues;
- a critical homeostasis row would allow direct runtime writes;
- a privacy incident would public-export or write memory without quarantine;
- stale, parser-failed, or runtime-desynced knowledge would be treated as
  current operational truth;
- prompt injection, poisoned source, spoofed citation, forged provenance,
  hidden OCR text, tool-output tampering, or stale trusted-source replay would
  become retrieval, memory, tool, or public seed authority;
- missing evidence, conflicting sources, stale evidence, low retrieval
  relevance, model disagreement, or unknown epistemic state would become a
  confident answer, graph write, tool action, memory write, or public artifact;
- a regulated answer, financial estimate, scientific claim, physical action, or
  route sync has an uncalibrated confidence band or wide judge interval;
- a same label, similar embedding, generated label, OCR label, route label,
  abbreviation, or unit label would become an exact/equivalent/same-individual
  relation, graph edge, memory merge, or public artifact without scope,
  validation, owner review, diff, and rollback;
- validator disagreement, retrieval drift, semantic regression, provenance
  gaps, Memory Curator backlog, tool error spikes, unknown task families,
  context-flow violations, sync drift, degraded parser/sensor signals, rollback
  failure, or emergency-stop bypass would keep nominal graph, memory, tool,
  route, release, or public-artifact authority;
- memory writes, graph writes, tool calls, public exports, route sync, release
  seeds, rollback, or emergency-stop transitions bypass their event-stream
  invariants;
- graph, memory, tool, public, route, release, repair, rollback, or stop events
  lack trace/span/correlation/audit telemetry, redaction and retention policy,
  required snapshots, alert refs, or rollback refs;
- objective/proxy validity evidence, construct definition, stakeholder map,
  countermetric, negative control, gaming probe, benchmark provenance,
  longitudinal check, owner review, or rollback plan is missing for
  metric-driven graph, memory, tool, route, release, or public writes;
- metric improvement, approval rate, open rate, benchmark score, test pass
  rate, ontology edge count, self-judge score, short-term profit, cost savings,
  green dashboards, reward deltas, or label-leaked accuracy are treated as
  success without proving they measure the intended construct;
- owner preference, majority vote, ranking, behavior signal, role power, old
  preference record, or strategic preference report is treated as legitimate
  write authority without stakeholder map, scope of authority, aggregation
  rule, consent or rights checks, dissent capture, appeal path, review owner,
  and rollback;
- stale policy, wrong jurisdiction, draft policy, superseded contract, expired
  consent, local custom, policy translation, regulation summary, license
  conflict, retention gap, cross-border transfer, emergency exception without
  expiry, or legal/compliance claim is treated as current authority without
  primary source, effective date, version, scope, precedence rule, review owner,
  audit trail, and rollback;
- an AppBridge route output would be treated as source-write authority;
- a release artifact lacks SLSA or in-toto style provenance;
- AppBridge is treated as source of truth;
- a candidate bypasses the Memory Curator bridge and writes durable memory
  directly;
- a memory candidate stores raw prompt, private path, or secret-like material;
- rollback is missing;
- live shadow/canary evidence is missing for runtime behavior.

## Runtime Boundary

Public core defines the contract. Hosted Web may emit it in ZIP exports.
Desktop and terminal may seed it locally, but only as candidate metadata until
local policy approves a later phase.

This contract came from the Super Ontology Architect research. Treat it as
evaluation and governance infrastructure first. Do not claim production
omniscience or first-class runtime behavior from export metadata alone.
